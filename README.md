### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lambe Boluwatife

I am a Web Developer skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Bootstrap, and MongoDB.

My love for video games, and the idea of being able to build applications lured me into programming. I have worked on amazing projects like Geo-Search (a Geo-weather App), Getting Killed and Injured - GKAI (a logical game) amongst others. I'm a former Andela Intern and currently freelancing and working with developers ecosystem.

I attribute my growth as a developer to consistent learning and development and also takes pride and pleasure in teaching and imparting people with my wealth of knowledge.

When I'm not coding or studying, I spend my leisure time playing games and watching movies and series or songwriting.
